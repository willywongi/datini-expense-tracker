    <h2>Datini Expense Tracker</h2>
    <p>
        This webapp is born just to satisfy the need for me and my wife to collaboratively track expenses. We've been using Google Sheet with a Google Form for a couple of years but I just want to move out this little piece of my life from the all-encompassing embrace of the big G.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project is opensource: you can find more info on getting the code or running an instance on your own server at the <a href="https://www.github.com/willywongi/datini-expense-tracker">GitHub page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The icon I'm using as a logo comes from: <strong>"<a href="https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=stationery&i=3012279">stationery</a>" by Azam Ishaq from the Noun Project</strong>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The name I chose from this project is inspired by the book "<a href="https://archive.org/details/merchantofpratof00orig">The merchant of Prato</a>" by Iris Origo. The book tells the story of Francesco di Marco Datini and how he mastered the art of keeping track of expenses.
